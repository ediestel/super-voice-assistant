## 📦 Installation Steps

### 1. Copy to Applications Folder

```bash
cp -r "/Users/eckhartdiestel/Desktop/Coding_Projects/super-voice-assistant/build/SuperVoiceAssistant.app" /Applications/
```

Or drag and drop the app from Finder to your Applications folder.

### 2. Configure API Keys

The app needs your API keys to function. These were already copied to the bundle if you had a `.env` file.

**Option A: Check if .env exists in the bundle**
```bash
ls -la /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app/Contents/Resources/.env
```

**Option B: Create/Edit .env file manually**
```bash
# Right-click app in Applications → Show Package Contents
# Navigate to Contents/Resources/
# Create .env file with:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Or from terminal:
```bash
cat > /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app/Contents/Resources/.env << 'EOF'
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
EOF
```

### 3. Grant Required Permissions

The app needs these permissions to function:

**Microphone Access** (Required)
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone
- Enable for Super Voice Assistant

**Accessibility Access** (Required for auto-paste and gestures)
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
- Click the lock to make changes
- Click + button
- Navigate to Applications and add Super Voice Assistant
- Enable the checkbox

### 4. Launch the App

**From Applications:**
```bash
open /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app
```

**Or double-click** SuperVoiceAssistant.app in Finder.

**First Launch Note**: macOS may show a security warning for apps not from the App Store.
- Right-click the app → Open
- Click "Open" in the dialog
- This only needs to be done once

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### App Won't Launch

**Check logs:**
```bash
open /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app
# Then check Console.app for crash logs
```

**Verify executable:**
```bash
file /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/SuperVoiceAssistant
# Should show: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```

### "App is Damaged" Error

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -cr /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app

# Re-sign the app
codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app
```

### API Keys Not Working

**Verify .env file:**
```bash
cat /Applications/SuperVoiceAssistant.app/Contents/Resources/.env
```

**Check format:**
- No spaces around `=`
- No quotes around keys (unless part of the key)
- One key per line

### Permissions Not Working

**Reset permissions:**
```bash
tccutil reset Microphone
tccutil reset Accessibility
```

Then re-grant permissions in System Settings.

### Recording Not Working

1. **Check microphone permission** (System Settings → Privacy → Microphone)
2. **Check selected audio input** (Settings → Audio Input Device)
3. **Verify API keys** are present in .env file
4. **Check Console.app** for error messages

## 🚀 Building Release Version

For production use, build a release version:

```bash
cd /Users/eckhartdiestel/Desktop/Coding_Projects/super-voice-assistant
./scripts/build_app_bundle.sh release
```

This creates an optimized build but requires fixing the test-text-inserter compilation issue first.

**Alternative (single architecture):**
```bash
swift build -c release
./scripts/build_app_bundle.sh release
```
